# **Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)**

Sequenced with 2x151bp reads on Illumina Novaseq 6000 or Nextseq 2000. Reads were mapped to SS14 reference NC_021508.1. 

Subsequent analysis was done by reprocessing _T.pallidum_ WGS reads using iterative competitive mapping with Bowtie2 to both Nichols (NC_021490.1) and SS14 (NC_021508.1) references. Variants were called with freebayes v.1.0.2 followed by deduplication with Picard MarkDuplicates, with a sequencing depth of 10. Consensus sequences contextualized by adding them to phylogeny of sequences from Seattle, WA from 2021-22.

_dnaA/TP0001_, _tp47/TP0574_, and _TP0136_: Discriminated between Nichols and SS14 Lineages

# _TP0865_ PCR amplification

To determine linkage between the recombinant regions in TP0865, we designed a pair of overlapping amplicons: Amplicon “A” amplifies a fragment of TP0865 that included a portion of the N-terminal “hatch” domain, the invariant ECL1, and the highly recombinant ECL2. Amplicon “B” amplifies ECL2, ECL3, and ECL4.
